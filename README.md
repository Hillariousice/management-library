### Python Library Management System

This library management system is built with Python. It allows you to manage your library collection, including books, movies, and music. You can add, edit, and delete items from your collection, as well as track who has checked out items and when they are due back.

**Installation**

To install the library management system, simply run the following command:

```
pip install library_management_system
```

**Usage**

Once the library management system is installed, you can start using it by running the following command:

```
python library_management_system.py
```

The library management system will prompt you to create a new library or open an existing one. Once you have created or opened a library, you can start adding items to your collection. To add a new item, simply enter the following command:

```
add <item_type> <item_name>
```

For example, to add a new book, you would enter the following command:

```
add book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy
```

Once you have added items to your collection, you can edit or delete them using the following commands:

```
edit <item_type> <item_name>
delete <item_type> <item_name>
```

You can also track who has checked out items and when they are due back using the following commands:

```
checkout <item_type> <item_name> <user_name>
check_in <item_type> <item_name>
```

The library management system also provides a number of reports that you can use to track your library collection. To view a report, simply enter the following command:

```
report <report_name>
```

For example, to view a report of all checked out items, you would enter the following command:

```
report checked_out_items
```
